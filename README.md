# bluech Client

**bluech** is a client chat-app designed to handle multi users, threaded, and other complex forms of chatting. 
The idea is to support media attachments, video & audio calls, text messages, and continuous notifications through its built-in push notification features.
Currently, it only supports text messaging and one-on-one single threaded user chat.
